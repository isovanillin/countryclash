        <h1>Welcome to the instructions!</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <div class="instructs">
         <p>Upon beginning the game, you will first see a multiple-choice question relating to history or geography. If answered correctly, you wil gain a hundred dollars. Currency will allow you to upgrade your nation - or it can help avoid territorial losses.</p>
         <p>Let's say you get asked <q>What sole nation does the Dominican Republic border?</q>, and recieve four possible answers. <q>Dominica</q>, <q>Belize</q>, <q>Haiti</q>, or the <q>United States of America</q>. Let's assume you chose Haiti.</p>
         <p>Being correct, you now have $100. If you don't stop getting questions right, you'll get $5 per question. If you lose that streak, you don't lose money.</p>
         <p>Round 5, and other rounds that are multiples of 5, are different. Each player must choose to either strengthen their military, strengthen their defence, invest in their economy, attack, or do nothing. Each will result in one statistic being increased with the other being decreased, so choose wisely!</p>
         <p>Here comes the fun part. What happens to you also relies on the other player's choice. If they choose to attack, while you choose to defend their chance of the attack succeeding goes down by a lot!</p>
        </div>
        
         <h3>Choices... choices...</h3>
        
        <div class="instructs">
         <p>What does each choice do? Good question.</p>
         <p>Choosing ATK increases it by a single point, and so does choosing DEF or ECO.</p>
         <p>Defending yourself while the other party chooses attack will result in their attack success rate being lowered by a good 20 percent. If their chance was already below or at 20 percent, it goes down to five percent automatically.</p>
         <p>Investing in your economy sounds vague, doesn't it? Canonically, it's just strengthening your education and healthcare. All the good stuff. It increases the money you get from answering questions correctly. It doesn't alter how much you get from streak bonuses.</p>
         <p>If you wanna get on the offensive, attacking the other relies on the difference between your ATK and their DEF. If your ATK is 5, and theirs is 5, your chance is equivalent to flipping a coin. If your ATK is 6, it goes up to 60 percent! If you both choose to attack, the percent chance of either of you succeeding is around 10. For who succeeds, it's another coin toss.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What are the rules?</h3>
        <div class="instructs">
        <p>Other than the usual rules like no hacking, there actually aren't really any rules to follow.</p>
        <p>Feel free to search up answers if you don't know them, so you learn more about history. Of course, make sure the other player is fine with this, so it's not cheating.</p>
